## Description

    This application is an easy to use and highly efficient way of creating a logo in virtually no time flat. Coming into this was a fun challenge and I got to learn a lot even outside of a course setting from a vast amount of resources. Creating this command line application brings a lot of new and learned skills to the table and I enjoyed getting to test myself. This application will make it as easy as a few selections to create a logo for anything the user may need it for.

## Usage

    To use this application, you must open it in Visual Studio Code and open the integrated terminal in the folder correlating to the application needing to be run. From there, be sure you have all packages installed by typing `npm i`. Once complete, type `node index.js` and it will populate questions, letting you, the user, create a logo from three different shape options and a muiltitude of colors for both the text and the logo. When the program has completed its run, a new svg file should populate in the logo-generator folder. Open that file in a browser and voila! You have created your own logo.
